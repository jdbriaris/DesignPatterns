# Overview
Standard *EN 62304* provides a framework of life cycle **processes** with **activities** and **tasks** necessary for the safe design and maintenance of medical device software.

## Software Development Activities
*EN 62304* defines a set of activities to be perfomred during the development of medical device software. These activities are depicted below.

The standard stipulates only that these activities are completed. It does not stipulate the documentation that must be produced, and it does not prescribe the life cycle model to be adopted by the project. In addition, not all medical device software is required to complete all the activities shown above (requisite activities will vary according to the class of device - Class A, B or C) and it is not necessary to complete activities in a prescribed order.

### Software development planning
The development of medical device software requires that the development team adopt a **software development plan** for conducting the activities of the software development process. This plan should be appropriate to the scope, magnitude, and safety classifications of the software system to be developed.

### Software requirements analysis
The development of medical device software requires that the manufacturer defines and documents the software system requirements from the system level requirements.

### Software architectural design
The software architectural design activity requires that the development team transform the software requirements into a documented architecture that describes the software system and identifies the **software items**, where a software item is any identifiable part of a computer program. Typically, medical device software is decomposed as follows:

![](http://yuml.me/diagram/boring/class/[Software System]1->*[Software Item],[Software Item]1->*[Software Unit]  "yUML")

where a **software unit** is a software item that is not subdivided into other items.

#### Defining a Software Unit
It can be difficult to describe what a software unit is; is it a class, a line of code or an entire process? Defining a software unit as a line of code is clearly far too granular, and so it's better to think in terms of software behaviour. The purpose of all software is to perform a set of behaviours that meet the requirements as defined during the software requirements analysis. Implementing these requirements typically requires the use of design patterns that encapsulates behaviour in a clean, decoupled and cohesive way. Thus it is possible to think of a software unit as *a behaviour encapsulated in a pattern that meets one or more requirements*.

Given the above definition, it is possible to think of a software system as a group of software items that can be released as a standalone product and fulfills a set of requirements (e.g. a drug delivery procedure). That software system is composed of any number of software items each of which describe a collection of behaviours, whilst a software unit describes a single behaviour.

### Software detailed design
The software detailed design process involves refining the software architecture such that it is represented by software units. The design for each software unit should be documented, as well as any interface the software unit exposes to external components (hardware or software) and other software units. All detailed design documents must be kept up to date and verified as such.

### Software unit implementation and verification
The development teams should establish strategies, methods and procedures for verifying each software unit. These strategies, methods and procedures should verify that the software unit meets the defined acceptance criteria. The results of this verifcation process should be documented.

### Software integration and integration testing
Developed software units should be integrated into the software product accroding to the software development plan - this process should be recorded and verified. All software units integrated into the softaware system should be tested and correctness of these tests verified.

### Software system testing
The development team should perform a set of tests with expected outcomes (pass/fail) that verify that all software requirements are covered. Anomalies in testing should be recorded and entered into a software resolution process, and re-run on completion of the resolution.
